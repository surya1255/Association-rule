# Association-rule
Association Rule learning is a rule-based machine learning technique which is used to find interesting relationships and associations hidden in large data-sets. This rule shows how frequently an itemset occurs in a dataset or transaction.

Market Based Analysis is one of the important methods used by large relations to show associations between items. Given a set of transactions or dataset, we can find rules that will predict the occurrence of specific item based on the occurrences of other items in the dataset.
